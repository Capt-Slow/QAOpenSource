h1. Over-View

This is the home of a blog project.  Make sure you:

* bundle install
* create development database
* edit config/database.yml
* edit config/config.yml
* run rake db:migrate
* run rake db:seed (change the password / login to something that works for you)

Your login name is now admin and password is admin if you didn't change anything

h2. ToDo

* Create tests.  This project didn't have tests so I will add them ASAP.
* clean up controller code and models (too much logic in the controller)
