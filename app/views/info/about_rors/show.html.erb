    <p>
      <span style="color:#8b1d1d;">RoR Ecommerce started because I wanted a better e-commerce solution.  I didn't like the current Ruby on Rails e-commerce solutions so much I had to write my own.  At the end of the day I hope you enjoy this project.</span>

      Start-up costs are very high and we understand that. RoR-e.com’s platform is specifically created to minimize those cost, decrease the time to develop an e-commerce platform in order to start making money and increase the opportunities for success.

      <span style="color:#8b1d1d;">Interested in RoR-e.com’s platform? We are currently evaluating potential partnerships and/or professional services opportunities.</span>
